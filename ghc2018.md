## <a id="visibility">10 Easy Tips to Get the Visibility You Need</a>

**Speaker:** Aimee Cardwell

Getting visibility isn't about:
- Your work speaking for itself
- Constant self-promotion
- Your relationships
- What you deliver

*You need to be seen doing your best*

1. Be the messenger
    * The messenger gets the halo of the credit, even if you weren't directly involved in the work.
    * Announce your teams success and celebrate and promote those around you (but don't do this for yourself at the risk of coming off as bragging)
2. Speak up
    * When you speak at meetings make sure what you say is concise, on point, and interesting
3. Make friends
    * Small talk!
    * The ability to engage wtih strangers in conversation is one of the best ways to expand your network
    * If you're nervous, treat them as if they were a guest in your dinner party - make them feel relaxed and comfortable
4. Sign up
    * Volunteer for extra credit projects that no one else wants to take on... and then rock them! This lets you meet people you wouldn't normally work with and expand your network.
5. Fix it
    * Take initiative to fix broken things that people have just gotten used to
    * If you succeed, you'll be a hero and will meet people outside your immediate team in the process. If you fail, nothing really changes. No one was expecting this to be fixed anyway.
6. How am I doing?
    * Ask for feedback and actionable advice from people you admire
7. Share it
    * Become a subject matter expert. Find others in your company who need your expertise and offer it freely and generously.
8. Get help
    * Ask for a mentor, career sponsor, or advocate
    * Having one or more advocates can help you stay aware of roles you might otherwise have missed
9. Speak out
    * Speak externally at meetups, schools, events, etc
10. Observe
    * Watch people in your organization who are well known. What do they do that you could learn from? Compare different styles.

### **Takeaway** 
We grow by practicing what we're not good at, not by practicing what we are good at.

MVP = Minimum Viable Product
- used to provide customers with a baseline to give feedback for future development

Early MVP
- Prototype
- Is there a market for this product?

Entry MVP
- Build
- Testing technology and minimum product; 6 - 8 months

Scale MVP
- Scaling to viable market

### **Questions to answer**
- Who is your customer?
- Competitive anaylsis - know the product area and market
- How will you deliver?

**If it doesn't matter to the customer, it shouldn't matter to you.**

Path to create customer value:
- Awareness of the problem
- Acquisition of customers
- Retention of customers
- Customers delighted

### **Do it once or do it again?**
You have to decide if you want more change or less change in the future in terms of UI / UX, visual design, business rules, service contracts, architecture, etc.

The general guideline is that you can rewrite things closer to the customer, but not closer to the lower level architecture. 

**If you don't have customer facing changes, are you really building anything of value?**

### **Non-negotiable for launch**
Some things are non-negotiable components for launch.
- Security and compliance
- Architecture and platform (write only once!)
- DevOps and maintainability
- Built for customer feedback (A/B testing, multivariance testing, etc)

**Everything else is negotiable!**

### **Art of minimal delivery**
You need to make decisions about...

Business aspects:
- Whether to keep a process manual vs make it automated
- Build vs buy vs opensource a solution
- Being okay with limited feature launches (ex: We will launch with support for credit card payment, but not for Paypal payment)
- Plan for scale, but don't build for scale yet

User experience:
- Good enough UX vs great UX
- Targeted form factors
- Real time data vs batch processed data

Technical implementations:
- Keeping things simple or making them complex (Use something that's proven in the market unless it's your differentiator)
- Error conditions and handling
- Performance

It's always better to build a product that's:
- Based on customer / data feedback
- Result focused
- A half product

instead of something that's:
- Based on internal opinions
- Ceremony focused
- Half baked

*Note: A half product is a product that only has partial features (like the credit card vs Paypal example above) and a half baked product is one that tries to cram in tons of features that are poorly executed.*

### **Takeaways**
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Keep what need to be done and how it is gets done separate
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

## <a id="business">Managing Your Career Like a Business</a>

**Speaker:** Marta Bralic Kerns, @martabralic

### **Quick stats**
30% of dev managers are women
20% of seniors are women
10% of executives are women
5% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women

The problem? **Women are less likely than men to actively manage their careers.**

Women are less deliberate than men in their career progressions, thinking "I will learn and grow and build" rather than "I will create opportunities to learn A and gain experience in B to get to position C." It's too abstract!

For day to day, thinking in terms of "who is my current boss and what are the tasks I need to do now / soon?", but you also need to look at the bigger picture frequently.

### **Active career management**
For your career to be managed like a business, you should have the following structure.

- Board of Advisors that advises the CEO
- CEO (yourself) who manages:
    - Career strategy
    - Skills development
    - Sales and marketing

### **Career strategy**
State with what you want your career to look like in 3, 5, 10 years and work backwards for actionable items to do today to work towards that.

1. Defining a three-year vision
    1. Write it out in detail
    2. Write out what you're doing that on track
    3. Write out what you're not doing that you should and what you still need to work on
2. Building a skills roadmap
    1. This is focused on the next 1 - 1.5 years
    2. Each skill has details on the timeframe for completion, the skill, next steps, success metrics, status
3. Recruiting an advisor
    1. Holds you accountable
