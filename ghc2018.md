**Speaker:** Aimee Cardwell

Getting visibility isn't about:
- Your work speaking for itself
- Constant self-promotion
- Your relationships
- What you deliver

*You need to be seen doing your best*

1. Be the messenger
    * The messenger gets the halo of the credit, even if you weren't directly involved in the work.
    * Announce your teams success and celebrate and promote those around you (but don't do this for yourself at the risk of coming off as bragging)
2. Speak up
    * When you speak at meetings make sure what you say is concise, on point, and interesting
3. Make friends
    * Small talk!
    * The ability to engage wtih strangers in conversation is one of the best ways to expand your network
    * If you're nervous, treat them as if they were a guest in your dinner party - make them feel relaxed and comfortable
4. Sign up
    * Volunteer for extra credit projects that no one else wants to take on... and then rock them! This lets you meet people you wouldn't normally work with and expand your network.
5. Fix it
    * Take initiative to fix broken things that people have just gotten used to
    * If you succeed, you'll be a hero and will meet people outside your immediate team in the process. If you fail, nothing really changes. No one was expecting this to be fixed anyway.
6. How am I doing?
    * Ask for feedback and actionable advice from people you admire
7. Share it
    * Become a subject matter expert. Find others in your company who need your expertise and offer it freely and generously.
8. Get help
    * Ask for a mentor, career sponsor, or advocate
    * Having one or more advocates can help you stay aware of roles you might otherwise have missed
9. Speak out
    * Speak externally at meetups, schools, events, etc
10. Observe
    * Watch people in your organization who are well known. What do they do that you could learn from? Compare different styles.

**Takeaway:** We grow by practicing what we're not good at, not by practicing what we are good at.
